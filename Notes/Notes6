Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

3 Types of Alerts:
1) Web Based Alerts/ HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2) Javascript Alert/ Browser Alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     we cannot inspect
3) Windows based Alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium - not window OS, it is a window window

Types of JS Alerts:
1) Simple Alert - click ok
2) Confirmation Alert - either cancel or click ok
3) Prompt Alert - Enter text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS Alerts, we only have 4 methods:
1) accept() -click ok
2) dismiss() - click on cancel
3) getText()
4) sendKeys()

Frames:
Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage.
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1) By index
2) By name or id
3) By using WebElement

In alerts - switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically
In frames - switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually

Interview Question:
How do you handle Alerts in Selenium?
We handle Alerts by using Alert interface.
